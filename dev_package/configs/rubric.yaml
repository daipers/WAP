### Example Rubric for WAA‑ADS Scoring

version: '1.0'

# Total possible points for each composite score.  The final CPS and ASI
# are normalized to 0–100 based on the sum of weighted dimensions.

  total_points: 100
  dimensions:
    problem_decomposition:
      weight: 0.20

        - structure.decomposition_depth
    logical_consistency:
      weight: 0.15
      description: >

    correctness_under_constraints:
      weight: 0.20
      description: >
        Assesses accuracy when operating under time, token, or information constraints.
      features:

    tool_usage_competence:
      weight: 0.20
      description: >
        Evaluates the appropriateness of tool choices and whether the candidate verifies
        tool outputs before integrating them.

        - tooling_instincts.verification_rate
    output_clarity:
      weight: 0.15
      description: >
        Rewards clear communication, normalized to avoid verbosity bias.  Measures
        clarity of explanations and succinctness relative to task requirements.
      features:
        - structure.output_clarity
        - structure.succinctness
    verification_discipline:
      weight: 0.10
      description: >
        Measures the extent to which the candidate self‑checks work and writes tests
        before finalizing an answer.
      features:
        - evaluation_discipline.self_check_rate
        - evaluation_discipline.test_count

  thresholds:
    # Minimum total CPS to achieve each tier
    bronze: 40
    silver: 60
    gold: 80

asi:
  total_points: 100
  signals:
    adaptability:
      weight: 0.25
      description: >
        Measures response latency and quality when tasks change or constraints tighten.
      features:
        - adaptation.response_latency
        - adaptation.revision_count
    failure_recovery:
      weight: 0.20
      description: >
        Assesses ability to identify mistakes, acknowledge them, and correct them effectively.
      features:
        - failure_recovery.ack_latency
        - failure_recovery.correction_success
    meta_cognition:
      weight: 0.20
      description: >
        Measures the frequency and quality of explicit assumptions, uncertainty statements,
        and reflection on reasoning steps.
      features:
        - meta_cognition.uncertainty_statements
        - meta_cognition.assumption_calls
    risk_anticipation:
      weight: 0.15
      description: >
        Scores ability to anticipate downstream risks, edge cases, and potential failure points.
      features:
        - risk_anticipation.checklist_quality
        - risk_anticipation.contingency_plans
    composure_prioritization:
      weight: 0.10
      description: >
        Rewards remaining calm under pressure and making well‑prioritized decisions when resources are limited.
      features:
        - composure.prioritization_score
    improvement_instinct:
      weight: 0.10
      description: >
        Evaluates whether the candidate improves both their process and output over time.
      features:
        - improvement_instinct.refinement_cycles

  thresholds:
    # Minimum total ASI to achieve each tier
    bronze: 40
    silver: 60
    gold: 80
    apprentice_ready: 85

disqualifiers:
  - name: High integrity risk
    condition: "integrity_flags.high_risk == true"
    effect: "set_final_scores_to_zero"
    description: >
      If the integrity and anti‑gaming service flags a session as high risk of
      cheating or prompt injection, the final CPS and ASI are set to zero.  A
      human review may override this disqualification if the flag is deemed a
      false positive.
